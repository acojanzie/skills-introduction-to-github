On one side
The forces of darkness
Are gathering in their legions

On the other
A secret alliance
Is sworn to keep the flame of truth alight
If two implacable foes
Are both fighting for what they hold most dear
What length will they go to in their struggle to prevail

And how much further will they go
If what both they're fighting for is the same thing
In a desperate conflict
With a ruthless enemy
